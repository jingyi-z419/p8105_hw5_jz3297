## Problem 1

Read in the data.

```{r load_clean_data}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

<br />

Let's look at this a bit.

```{r look_data}
aggregate_df =  
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )

aggregate_df
```

<br />

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

```{r prop_test}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy() # gives you a tidy version of statistical results
```

<br />

Try to iterate ......

```{r iterate}
results_df =
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)), # map two inputs
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x)) # tidy version of the tests
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

results_df
```

<br />

```{r results_plot}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

<br />

```{r prop_function}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

<br />

## Problem 2

Create a tidy dataframe containing all file names.

```{r load_files}
path_df =
  tibble(
    path = list.files(path = "lda_data"),
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)) %>%
  unnest(data)
```


```{r tidy_data1}
lda_df =
  path_df %>%
    mutate(
      subject_id = str_remove(path, "lda_data/"),
      subject_id = str_remove(subject_id, ".csv")
    ) %>% 
    select(subject_id, week_1:week_8)

lda_df
```


```{r tidy_data2}
lda_df =
  lda_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "measurement"
  ) %>% 
  separate(subject_id, into = c("group", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    group = str_replace_all(group, c("con" = "control", "exp" = "experiment"))
  )


lda_df
```

<br />

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

```{r subject_time_plot}
subject_time_plot =
  lda_df %>%
  unite(subject_id, group, id, sep = "_", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = measurement)) +
  geom_path(aes(color = group, group = as.factor(subject_id))) +
  labs(
    title = "Measurement over time",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Measurement"
  )
  
subject_time_plot
```

```{r save plot1, include = FALSE}
ggsave("./results_plot/subject_time_plot.pdf", subject_time_plot, width = 8, height = 7)
```

* From the graph, both the experiment and control group had similar baseline measurements at week 1. The experiment group had showed an increase in measurements throughout eight weeks of experiment. In comparison to the control group, the measurements did not change significantly during this time interval. 

<br />

## Problem 3

Create a function with fixed n = 30, sigma = 5.

```{r create_function}
sim_mean_t = function(n = 30, mu, sigma = 5) { #default sample size and sd
  
  sim_data =
    tibble(
     x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    )
  
  sim_data %>%
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      t_test = t.test(x, mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95) %>% 
        broom::tidy() %>% 
        select(p.value)
  )
  
}
```

<br />

Set mu = 0, generate 5000 dataset from a normal distribution.

```{r generate_mu_0}
set.seed(7)
sim_results =   
  rerun(5000, sim_mean_t(mu = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  mutate(p_value = t_test$p.value) %>% 
  select(mu_hat, p_value)

sim_results
```

<br />

Repeat the same process for mu = 1,2,3,4,5,6, test against null hypothesis mu = 0.

```{r repaet_process, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
sim_results =
  tibble(
    mu = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~rerun(5000, sim_mean_t(mu = .x))),
    estimate_results_df = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_results_df)

sim_results =
  sim_results %>% 
  mutate(p_value = t_test$p.value) %>% 
  select(mu, mu_hat, p_value)

sim_results
```

<br />

Make a plot showing the power of the test. Describe the association between effect size and power.

```{r power_test_plot}
power_test_plot =
  sim_results %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  filter(p_value < 0.05) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_rej = n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    prop_rej = n_rej / 5000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = prop_rej, color = mu)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = seq(0,6,1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Power of test vs. true mu",
    x = "True mu",
    y = "Power of test"
  )
 
power_test_plot
```

```{r save plot2, include = FALSE}
ggsave("./results_plot/power_test_plot.pdf", power_test_plot, width = 9, height = 7)
```

* The power increases as the effect size (mu) increases. As the true mu increases, the proportion of rejecting the null hypothesis (mu = 0) increases and approaches 1. 

<br />

Make a plot showing the average estimate of mu hat on the y axis and the true value of mu on the x axis. 

```{r estimate_mu_plot}
estimate_all_plot =
  sim_results %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_estimate = mean(mu_hat)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = mean_estimate, color = mu)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1), color = "red", size = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = seq(0,6,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1,6), breaks = seq(-1,6,1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Mean estimate of mu vs. true mu",
    x = "True mu",
    y = "Mean estimate of mu"
  )

estimate_all_plot
```


```{r save plot3, include = FALSE}
ggsave("./results_plot/estimate_all_plot.pdf", estimate_all_plot, width = 9, height = 7)
```

<br />

Make a second plot showing the average estimate of mu hat only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of mu on the x axis.

```{r estimate_mu_rej_plot}
estimate_rej_plot =
  sim_results %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  filter(p_value < 0.05) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_estimate_rej = mean(mu_hat)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = mean_estimate_rej, color = mu)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1), color = "red", size = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = seq(0,6,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1,7), breaks = seq(-1,7,1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Mean estimate of mu(rejected) vs. true mu",
    x = "True mu",
    y = "Mean estimate of mu(rejected)"
  )

estimate_rej_plot 
```

```{r save plot4, include = FALSE}
ggsave("./results_plot/estimate_rej_plot.pdf", estimate_rej_plot, width = 9, height = 7)
```

Is the sample average of mu across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of mu? Why or why not?

* For mu = 0,1,2,3, the sample average of mu for which the null is rejected deviates significantly from the true value of mu. For mu = 4,5,6, the sample average of mu for which the null is rejected is approximately equal to the true value of mu. This is because the power of the test increases as the effect size (true mu) increases. In other words, the probability that a false null hypothesis is rejected increases as mu increases (effect size).
